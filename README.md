# Full Stack Web App with Clerk Auth, NextAuth.js, Socket.IO, and PostgreSQL

This document outlines the architecture for a full-stack web application that utilizes Clerk Auth for user authentication, Bitly API for URL shortening, ClerkAuth for server-side authentication, Socket.IO for real-time communication, Notion API for taking Notes and PostgreSQL for data storage.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js
- **Authentication:** Clerk Auth
- **Real-time communication:** Socket.IO
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL

## Components

### Clerk Auth

Handles user signup, login, and logout functionalities.

### NextAuth.js

Provides server-side authentication and session management on top of Clerk Auth.

### Socket.IO

Enables real-time communication between the frontend and backend for features like live chat or notifications.

### Frontend (Next.js)

Renders the user interface and interacts with the backend API using data fetching methods like getStaticProps or getServerSideProps.

### Backend (Node.js, Express.js)

Provides API endpoints for user data management, potentially integrating with other services or databases.

### PostgreSQL

Stores user data, session information, and potentially other application data.

## Data Flow

### User Signup/Login

1. User interacts with the Clerk Auth frontend widget for signup or login.
2. Clerk Auth handles user credentials and communicates with its servers for authentication.
3. NextAuth.js on the backend receives authentication data from Clerk Auth and creates or verifies user sessions.

### URL Creation
1. User can send wrappers and tags as a POST request to Bitly API
2. API will return a custom URL which is saved in database alongside long URL

### User Interaction

- User interacts with the frontend application.
- The frontend application first redirect to Booking Page where they can book their client and pay directly into bank account using Stripe
- The frontend fetches data or performs actions by calling backend API endpoints.
- The backend retrieves data from PostgreSQL or interacts with other services as needed.

### Real-time Communication (optional)

- Frontend and backend can leverage Socket.IO for real-time features like chat or data updates.
- Socket.IO establishes a persistent connection between the client and server.
- Notion API is used to save notes taken during the session.
- Session info is stored in a seperate table that can be viewed later.

## Deployment

- The frontend (Next.js app) can be deployed to a platform like Vercel or Netlify.
- The backend (Node.js, Express.js) can be deployed to a cloud platform like AWS, Azure, or Heroku.

## Benefits

- **Simplified Authentication:** Clerk Auth streamlines user authentication and provides a user management dashboard.
- **Secure Sessions:** NextAuth.js offers robust session management on the server-side.
- **Real-time Features:** Socket.IO enables interactive features and real-time data updates.
- **Scalable Architecture:** The separation of frontend and backend and use of load balancers, horizontal scaling and sharting allows for independent scaling.

This architecture provides a solid foundation for building a modern web application with secure authentication, real-time features, and scalable components.
